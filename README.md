Person REST API
The task implements a simple REST API for managing "person" resources, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting person records (CRUD). The API is developed using FastAPI and can interface with any chosen database. It also dynamically handles parameters, allowing you to perform operations based on user-provided input, such as a person's name.

Features
CRUD Operations: The API supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on person resources.
Secure Database Interaction: Interactions with the database are secure and protected against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injections.
Dynamic Parameter Handling: The API can process operations based on user-provided parameters, such as a person's name.
Detailed Documentation: A comprehensive documentation file outlines request/response formats, setup instructions, and sample API usage.
